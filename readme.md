# Params Echo Server

## 🎮 About the Project
I built a simple server using Node.js that reads the URL and query parameters from an incoming HTTP request. The server then returns a JSON response containing two parts: 
- `parts`: an array of the segments in the URL's `pathname`
- `query`: an object with the key-value pairs of all query parameters.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (For building the server and handling HTTP requests)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For maintaining consistent code quality  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing the server functionality  

## 📌 Features
✅ Returns the parts of the URL's `pathname`  
✅ Extracts query parameters from the URL and returns them as key-value pairs  
✅ Provides a structured JSON response with `parts` and `query`  

## 🌐 Demo
To run the app, clone the repository and start the server locally using Node.js. Test it by making GET requests with various URLs and query parameters.
